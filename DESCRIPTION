Description: Map-based genotype correction algorithm that calculates Identity-by-descent probabilities based
  on 1) homologue assignment matrix (phased genotypes) and 2) a preliminary genetic map. Mapping is also implemented
  using R packages MDSmap and PolymapR, creating a map-building pipeline that can handle genotyping errors at 
  any ploidy level. The smooth descent algorithm is based on SMOOTH (van Os et al. 2006) <doi:10.1007/s00122-005-0124-y>.
  A developer version of this package can be found on Github <https://github.com/Alethere/SmoothDescent>
