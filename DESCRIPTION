Description: SmoothDescent implements an algorithm of the same name that allows
for genotype correction independently of ploidy, given a genetic map and a 
homologue matrix (matrix of phased parental markers). 
It allows to naïvely estimate Identity-By-Descent (IBD) probabilities, 
using them to estimate putative erroneous genotypes and to impute corrected genotypes. 
SmoothDescent also allows the estimation of a genetic maps with the help
of `polymapR` and `MDSMap`. Finally, a set of diagnostic tools have been included
to evaluate the results of the algorithm, including: recombination count,
recombination-distance plots, graphical genotypes, and map comparison plots.
