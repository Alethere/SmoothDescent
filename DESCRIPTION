Description: Map-based genotype correction algorithm that calculates Identity-by-descent probabilities based
  on 1) homologue assignment matrix and 2) preliminary genetic map. Mapping is also implemented
  using MDSmap and PolymapR, creating a map-building pipeline that can handle genotyping errors at any ploidy level.
