\usage{
smooth_descent(
  geno,
  homologue,
  map,
  ploidy = 2,
  p1name = NULL,
  p2name = NULL,
  prediction_interval = 10,
  error_threshold = 0.8,
  verbose = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{geno}{matrix with markers on the rows, individuals on the columns. Row names
are expected.}

\item{homologue}{matrix with markers on the rows, homologue names on the columns.
Rownames and columnames expected.}

\item{map}{data.frame with at least columns "marker" and "position". If it is
not specified, a map will be estimated from the uncorrected genotype data with polymapR.}

\item{ploidy}{numeric indicating the ploidy. Both parents must be of the same ploidy,
and it is assumed that "homologue" has 2*ploidy columns.}

\item{p1name}{character, name of the first parent. Must be present in the geno columnames.
If it's not specified it will be taken as the name of the first column.}

\item{p2name}{character, name of the second parent. Must be present in the geno columnames.
If it's not specified it will be taken as the name of the second column.}

\item{prediction_interval}{numeric, interval to be used during the IBD prediction
step. It should be specified in the same units as the "position" in the map.}

\item{error_threshold}{numeric, threshold over which a marker is considered erroneous.
Usually 0.8 should be good enough to be sensitive but stringent (not have false positives)}

\item{verbose}{logical, should smooth descent report the steps it takes?}
}
\value{
A list containing the following items:
* obsIBD: list of observed IBD matrices (marker x individual) for each parental homologue
* predIBD: list of predicted IBD matrices (marker x individual) for each parental homologue
* oldmap: data.frame containing the original map
* error: list of error matrices (marker x individual) for each parental homologue
* newIBD: list of observed IBD matrices of the corrected genotypes.
* newgeno: matrix containing the new genotypes.
* rec: list containing the recombination counts using the observed IBD (`obs`),
the predicted IBD (`pred`) and the updated IBD (`new`), using the given map order.
For more information see `rec_count()`.

\description{
This function applies the IBD calculation, IBD prediction, error estimation
and genotype prediction functions according to the Smooth Descent algorithm.
Provided with a genotype matrix, a parental homologue assignment matrix and
a genetic map, it is able to estimate putative genotyping errors as well
as recombination counts and imputed genotypes with less errors.
